I am a dynamic student with a genuine interest in new technologies and finance. I envision myself working within the Financial Services Industry to help drive positive change for stakeholders and our society thanks to a Socially Responsible data-driven approach which considers negative externalities. I believe we should value everyone’s diversities within an inclusive environment. In my spare time I tutor students underrepresented in higher education.

I’m currently completing my post-graduate studies at London Business School in Financial Analysis while I hold a BSc Hons in Mathematics with Finance and Economics.
I’m engaged in various extra-curricular activities while I practice Sport quite intensively especially running, cycling, and swimming.

I’ve collected experiences in Data Analysis, Consulting, FinTech and Entrepreneurship, something that gives me a well-rounded interdisciplinary background. I founded and led a student society for over one year and I have been a senior member of many others. I attended several courses as visiting student at Stanford University, University College London, and London School of Economics.
