As a dynamic and curious professional with a keen interest in the buy-side, I am committed to leveraging the latest innovations to drive positive change within the Financial Services Industry. My approach is based on a socially responsible, data-driven strategy that takes negative externalities into account. I strongly believe that we should value diversity and create inclusive environments where everyone feels respected and valued. In my free time, I enjoy tutoring underrepresented students, helping to bridge the gap between higher education and underprivileged communities.

I graduated from London Business School (LBS -Masters in Financial Analysis), and I am currently working at Privium Fund Management in London, being responsible for the Investment and Risk Oversight of UK clients. During the onboarding and investment monitoring process, I have frequent interactions with clients pursuing strategies that span across sectors, asset classes, and financial instruments. To excel in my role, I need to have client focus, attention to detail, the ability to multitask, and a deep understanding of the alternative sector, particularly hedge funds. I work closely with compliance and regional teams, while also developing a comprehensive understanding of various investment strategies.

To perform my duties effectively, I constantly apply the analytics and sales experience acquired at Bloomberg LP, research skills developed while working in private equity and fintech research, and coding skills developed as a data analyst. My background in entrepreneurship gives me the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment and develop out-of-the-box solutions to daily challenges. Through my experience, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the investment landscape, which enables me to provide exceptional service to clients and achieve the best results.

During my Master's in Financial Analysis at LBS, and my undergraduate studies in Mathematics & Economics, with exchanges at Stanford, LSE, and UCL, I engaged in various extra-curricular activities and held multiple ExCo positions in several student-led societies -including the LBS Investment Club- where I created tangible value for the members.

As Aristotle once said, "a healthy mind in a healthy body." This quote inspires me to pursue my passion for sports, as I believe that physical well-being is essential to maintaining mental clarity and focus. By taking care of our bodies, we can unlock our full potential and bring our best selves to every aspect of our lives.
